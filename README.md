# RRT
Automatic Raid Lockout Resetter on specified days


Since raid lockouts are not resetting by default every wednesday and I've gotten annoyed by raid members constantly having to leave raid, reset their own lockouts (and clicking on All Raids instead of the specific raids), I've built an addon that automates this process.

**RRT Features**
- Automatically resets all dungeon and raid lockouts the first time you login on a character on specified days (wednesday by default, more days can be toggled on)
- Option to have it auto reset all lockouts everytime you leave a raid group
- Slash command to instantly clear all your saved lockouts

**Useage**
Type /rrt to open the config menu and /rrt reset to instantly clear all your saved lockouts.

This is split - off functionality from another addon I will release in the future, now seperated into its own addon. Still in an early beta version, but seems to work so far.
